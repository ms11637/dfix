-*FEX_DESCRIPTION=ZCOMP (Record Compress) Exit example for SAM type files
-*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*

-TYPE The ZCOMP exit is a programable exit to allow files that
-TYPE are stored in a compressed format to be read. It does this
-TYPE by letting the standard I/O routines retrieve a record and
-TYPE then "runs" the data through a decompression routine before
-TYPE using the record (ie. printing a field or screening on it).
-TYPE
-TYPE The exit is applicable to all SAM type of files, such as
-TYPE VSAM (SUFFIX=VSAM on mainframe), CISAM (SUFFIX=CISAM on UNIX
-TYPE and Windows) and RMS (SUFFIX=RMS on OpenVMS) plus plain
-TYPE sequential files (SUFFIX=FIX/COM) if the request is complex
-TYPE enough that FOCSAM retrieval is called.
-TYPE
-TYPE For this test, we will be using a SUFFIX=FIX example since
-TYPE it is common to all platforms and portable.
-TYPE
-TYPE This test depends on a zcomp sample (stored in etc/src3gl/zcomp.c)
-TYPE having already been built already under the zcomp name and entry
-TYPE point (typically via gencpgm) and the IBICPG variable set to the
-TYPE appropriate location. See the Stored Procedures Manual on use of
-TYPE gencpgm and setting IBICPG if you are not familiar with gencpgm
-TYPE and IBICPG usage.
-TYPE
-TYPE Currently the standard ZCOMP example supplied with the product
-TYPE is the C based zcomp.c, but any language may be used provided
-TYPE it has the standard entry points as the C example. An actual
-TYPE ZCOMP exit does not have to be called zcomp, it may have any
-TYPE name as the routine to call is set at run time any number of
-TYPE routines supporting decompression may exist and be easily
-TYPE swapped in and out.
-TYPE
-TYPE Traces in this exerciser are set to display zcomp trace activity
-TYPE in the user output. If you are using the standard zcomp sample
-TYPE you will also see print statements each time a zcomp entry point
-TYPE is accessed.
